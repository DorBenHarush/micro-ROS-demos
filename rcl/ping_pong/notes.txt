The file main_with_executor.c contains the ping_pong example with the 
rclc executor. 

Some notes:
1. I could not compile the original main(), because I don't have microxrcedds
   installed, therefore I wrote a similar application without it (for the time
   being)
2. After compiling, this ping-pong with ROS 2 Dashing got a segmentation fault 
   while executing rcl_take 
3. I replaced the message type from std::msgs::Header to std::msgs::String
   then I could run the program
4. The rclc Executor does not support guard conditions yet. Therfore I replaced
   the guard condition with a timer to publish the ping message
5. I did not get the ping-pong running, because the received ping message is
   always the same as in the timer (aka send from the guard condition)
   I probably did not correctly the setup. Please explain.
